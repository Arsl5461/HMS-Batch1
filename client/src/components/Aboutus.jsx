The hospital aims to provide quality healthcare in a compassionate & patient-<br/> centred environment. Over 600,000 patients from Lahore and the province of Punjab are treated every year at the hospital making it one of the busiest<br/>

    hospitals in the city. The ability to provide quality treatment to such a large number of patients diligently and efficiently is key to Shalamar Hospitalâ€™s success.<br/> Shalamar Hospital opened its door to patients in 1978 as a 50 bedded hospital for the underprivileged members of the community. The hospital initially had<br/> six departments and today has evolved to become a multi-disciplinary tertiary care teaching hospital. Shalamar Hospital now offers services in 27 clinical<br/>specialities which are backed by highly trained doctors, state-of-the-art equipment, operation theatres and diagnostic facilities.</p>
